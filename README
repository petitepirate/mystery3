Only one small question this week - I chose to have a dropdown selection
of currencies in my html index based off of the JSON that forex provides, but 
a lot of the codes don't seem to work.  But the standard ones like AUS/EUR/USD 
do work.  I'm just curious if I'm just pulling the data incorrectly or if its 
something else causing the issue.
